Roact-Ketchup is an ergonomic binding between [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact), a view library, and [Ketchup](https://github.com/zoebasil/ketchup), a super simple state thing i made.

Usage is pretty much the same as in roact-rodux, just give the StoreProvider a ketchup store instead of a rodux store.
